# Flask_Student_Information_System
I made a flask app that shows you student information in which you can update information, edit it and delete it
# How to run it:
You need to download the files and open them in your prefered IDE and then run flask, for linux the command is "flask run"
which will then give you a http and some ip and a port. Open that and it will take you to the website
